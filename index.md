# Programming Notes

This site collects concise notes on programming languages, frameworks, and development
tools. They aim to serve as simple references for programmers with some experience in the
respective topics, not introductory tutorials or full technical documentation. Each note
includes a Resources section with links for different audiences.

## Disclaimer

These are personal notes intended as a reference. They do not claim
to be complete, up to date, or free of errors; they reflect what the author
considered worth writing down at a given time in his learning journey. Significant
additions and revisions may occur at any time.

## How to Contribute

Because this site is a personal collection of notes, major
additions or rewrites are unlikely to be accepted. However, factual corrections or clarifications
to the notes, as well as improvements to the source code, are very welcome. Suggestions
for overall improvements or future additions are also appreciated.

To contribute your improvements or ideas, you can either open an issue on GitHub in the
[repository](https://github.com/keblisch/keblisch.github.io/issues) or message the author directly via
[kevin.blischke@proton.me](mailto:kevin.blischke@proton.me). Pull requests for the
[repository](https://github.com/keblisch/keblisch.github.io) are also accepted when they only
contain small corrections or improvements to the notes or source code.
